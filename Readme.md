# Terminal Input Interface with Crossterm

This example demonstrates how to use Rust and crossterm to accept both piped stdin input and interactive terminal input in a single CLI app. Given the scarcity of examples on piping into crossterm, I created this to provide an example for anyone trying to do the same.
## Features

- **Piped `stdin` Input**: Seamlessly accept input piped from other commands or scripts.
- **Interactive Terminal Input**: Engage with a responsive terminal interface, typing and interacting in real-time.
- **Colorful UI**: Distinct colors differentiate prompts, user input, and system responses, enhancing readability.
- **Command Handling**: Commands like `exit` and `quit` are recognized, allowing for a graceful application termination.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Utilize `CTRL+C` to exit swiftly and the backspace key for text corrections.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Rust and Cargo are part of your development toolkit. If they're missing, acquire them from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cosmikwolf/terminal-input-interface.git
   cd terminal-input-interface
   ```

3. **Build & Run**:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

4. **Experience Piped Input**:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello from the other side" | cargo run
   ```

## Dependencies
